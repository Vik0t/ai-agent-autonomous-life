## Project Overview

### The Challenge
Create a web application with autonomous AI agents that have:
- Personalities
- Memories
- Emotions
- Relationships
- Web interface for observation and interaction

### Our Solution
A virtual world simulator where AI agents live autonomously with:
- Real-time interaction capabilities
- Emotional intelligence
- Long-term memory storage
- Complex relationship dynamics
- User intervention tools

---

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React with D3.js
- **Database**: Vector memory system
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT integration

### Key Components
1. Agent Personality System
2. Emotion Engine
3. Vector Memory Storage
4. Multi-agent Communication
5. Real-time Dashboard

---

## Agent Features

### Personality Model
- OCEAN personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism)
- Influences decision-making and communication style

### Emotional Intelligence
- 6 primary emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust)
- Emotions change based on events and interactions
- Affect communication style

### Memory System
- Vector database for long-term storage
- Automatic summarization of old memories
- Context-based memory retrieval

### Relationship Dynamics
- Affinity and familiarity metrics
- Relationship changes based on interactions
- Long-term relationship formation

---

## User Interface

### Dashboard Features
- Real-time event feed
- Interactive relationship graph
- Agent inspector panel
- Control panel for interventions

### User Controls
- Add global events
- Send direct messages
- Adjust simulation speed
- Observe agent emotions and relationships

---

## Demonstration

### What We'll Show
1. Autonomous agent interactions
2. Emotion changes in real-time
3. Memory formation and retrieval
4. Relationship development
5. User intervention capabilities

### Live Demo
[Presenter notes: Walk through the interface and show agents communicating, emotions changing, and relationships developing]
